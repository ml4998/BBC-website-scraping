      In the BBC movie project, I scraped this BBC website using Beautiful Soup, Playwright, and regular Expressions. As a result, I created a searchable database (multiple CSV files) that includes a list of all the directors from the website, movie names, critic names, director nationalities, and links to their homepages on IMBD.

      The project includes two kinds of data visualizations: a map that has data on what kind of pizza is the most popular in each state and a chart that includes what kinds of pizza are the most popular and the least popular in each country. To complete this project, I manually created two CSV files that have the following data: the number of states that favor a certain style of pizza and what kind of pizza each state favors. I used Datawrapper to generate data visualizations.
